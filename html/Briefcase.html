<h1>Download data from ODK Aggregate</h1>
<p>Creates .csv files and binary data files on your local filesystem.</p>
<p><a href="#Csv">Import .csv files manually</a> to preserve non-latin text.</p>
<p><a href="#Cert">Import the signing certificate</a> to stop the security warnings.</p>
<p>You must already be logged into Aggregate from within this browser in order to access the uploaded data.</p>
<h3>Retrieving All Data</h3>
<p>To extract all data from Aggregate, repeat the following steps for all form identifiers:</p>
<ol>
<li>Specify a download directory location (this cannot already contain downloaded data).</li>
<li>Choose `Download nested repeat groups.`</li>
<li>Choose `Download binary data and replace server URL with the local filename in the csv.` (e.g., images, audio, video).</li>
<li>For the `odkId`, specify a <em>form identifier</em> (shown on Aggregate's List Forms page). The odkId in an 
<a href="#OdkId">xpath-like expression</a> that can describe a specific subset of data.</li>
<li>Choose `Retrieve`</li>
<li>Repeat for all form identifiers.</li>
</ol>
<p>Should your download fail, read how to <a href="#Resume">resume a failed download attempt.</a></p>

<h3><a name="OdkId">The xpath-like OdkId</a></h3>
<p>The basic structure of an odkId is:</p>
<pre>form-identifier/top-level-tag/repeat-group/nested-repeat-group/...</pre>
<p>Where:</p><ul>
<li><code>form-identifier</code>: the form identifier shown on the List Forms page.</li>
<li><code>top-level-tag</code>: the name of the top-level data tag (the one with the <code>form-identifier</code> as an id attribute value or xmlns name).</li>
<li><code>repeat-group</code>: the name of a repeating data tag within the <code>top-level-tag</code> instance.</li>
<li><code>nested-repeat-group</code>: the name of a repeating data tag nested within the <code>repeat-group</code>, above.</li>
</ul>
<p>An xpath-like filter condition can be applied to the last and next-to-last elements of the odkId. 
The only filter criteria currently supported filters on the unique key of a data record.  For example:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>HouseholdSurvey1/HouseholdSurvey/ChildrenOfHousehold</code> returns all <code>ChildrenOfHousehold</code> data for all submitted <code>HouseholdSurvey1</code> forms (all children in all households).</li>
<li><code>HouseholdSurvey1/HouseholdSurvey/ChildrenOfHousehold[@key="bb"]</code> returns the single <code>ChildrenOfHousehold</code> with the unique key "bb" (a specific child).</li>
<li><code>HouseholdSurvey1/HouseholdSurvey[@key="aaa"]/ChildrenOfHousehold</code> returns all <code>ChildrenOfHousehold</code> data that are associated with the <code>HouseholdSurvey</code> with unique key "aaa" (all the children of a single household).</li>
</ul>
<h3><a name="Resume">Resuming a failed download attempt</a></h3>
<p>If your download begins fetching files and fails before completing the retrieval, 
the <code>Manifest.txt</code> file in your download directory 
will contain information like this:</p>
<pre>
BriefcaseVersion: 1.0
RunDate: Aug 10, 2010
ServerUrl: http://localhost:8888/
OdkId-1: HouseholdSurvey1/HouseholdSurvey/ChildrenOfHousehold
CsvFileName-1: \csvData\ChildrenOfHousehold.HouseholdSurvey.HouseholdSurvey1.csv
OdkId-2: HouseholdSurvey1/HouseholdSurvey
CsvFileName-2: \csvData\HouseholdSurvey.HouseholdSurvey1.csv
LastCursor-2: E9oBpgFqoAFqC29wZW5kYXRha2l0cpABCxJjCgAaI0hvdXNlaG9sZFN1cnZleTFDaGlsZHJlbk9mSG91c2Vob2xkIzAFcjYaClBBUkVOVF9LRVkgAComY2oLb3BlbmRhdGFraXRzehBIb3VzZWhvbGRTdXJ2ZXkxgAECdGQkDAsSI0hvdXNlaG9sZFN1cnZleTFDaGlsZHJlbk9mSG91c2Vob2xkGAUMggEA4AEAFA
LastKEY-2: http://localhost:8888/csvFragment?odkId=HouseholdSurvey1%2FHouseholdSurvey%5B%40key%3D%22agtvcGVuZGF0YWtpdHIWCxIQSG91c2Vob2xkU3VydmV5MRgCDA%22%5D
Completion-Status: Failure
</pre>
<p>To resume the fetch, simply locate the `LastCursor-x:` field (there will be only one in the file), 
copy its value into the `LastCursor-x:` prompt above, 
and do the same for the corresponding `LastKEY-x:` and `OdkId-x:` fields.</p>
<p>Resumed fetches must download data to a new download directory.  While the applet ensures that 
 the top-level form entries are never duplicated and that processing picks up where it ended, 
  there may be duplicates in the repeated groups and binary data nested under that top-level form.</p>
<p> Resolving the duplicates is a manual process.  Binary data files have repeatably unique 
names and can simply be consolidated into a single directory; any duplicates should be identical 
copies of the same file.  The csv files should be manually concatenated then sorted by their 
rightmost column (the KEY) column), and any duplicate rows removed.</p>
<h2>Known Issues</h2>
<h3><a name="Csv">Import .csv file contents manually</a></h3>
<p>The csv files should be interpreted as containing UTF-8 characters. Unfortunately, browsing to the file 
and double-clicking to open Excel will cause them to be loaded into a spreadsheet with the default ANSI (latin) 
character encoding.  Instead, you need to:</p>
<ol><li>Open the Excel 2007 application</li>
<li>create a new workbook or open an existing workbook</li>
<li>choose Data/Import Text</li>
<li>Browse to the downloaded .csv file; hit Open</li>
<li><b>Text Import Wizard - Step 1 of 3</b> opens.</li>
<li>Choose `Delimited`</li>
<li>Under `File origin:` select <code>65001 : Unicode (UTF-8)</code></li>
<li>Hit Next to advance to <b>Text Import Wizard - Step 2 of 3</b></li>
<li>Choose only `Comma` for the delimiters.</li>
<li>Uncheck the `Treat consecutive delimiters as one` checkbox</li>
<li>Hit Finish or, choose Next to define the formatting for specific columns.</li></ol>
<p>The data will now be loaded into Excel 2007 with UTF-8 characters properly interpreted.</p>
<h3><a name="Cert">Import the signing certificate</a></h3>
<p>This applet is signed with a self-signed certificate created by the OpenDataKit team.  If you are 
accessing this page frequently, you may want to import the certificate into your browser's certificate 
store to suppress the security warnings.  Note that whenever you import a certificate, you are trusting 
the owner of that certificate with your system security, as it will allow any software that the owner 
signs to be transparently executed on your system. Click <a href="/briefcase/OpenDataKit.cer">here</a> to 
download the certificate.  Then import it to suppress the security warnings; on Windows systems, 
the most restricted way to import the certificate would be through <code>Control Panel/Java</code>. Go to 
the <code>Security</code> tab, click <code>Certificates...</code> then <code>Import</code> to import 
the certificate.</p>
